# ARP-Spoof
A simple ARP Spoofer I wrote to make myself the man in the middle.

## Setup
Use -t or --target to set the IP of the machine you wish to target.
Use -g or --gateway to set the IP of your gateway.

Once you run the script it will spoof your target IP into thinking you are are gateway, and it will spoof the gateway into thinking you are the target IP. 
You will become the Man in the Middle.
